# Formalization of the Lambda-Q# calculus

## Build
`dune build` for build and `dune clean` for cleanup.

## Hacking
Use VSCode with VSCoq extension or any other Proof General based IDE for Coq. Once built, things should work.

Use the `vendor` directory for external libs.

## Misc
[ProtoQuipperFormalization](ProtoQuipperFormalization/README.md) contains the "Formalization of Metatheory of the Quipper Quantum Programming Language" that we are using as a guide/framework for this work.
